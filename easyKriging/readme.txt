'easyKriging' is a Matlab toolbox prepared by Jack Pierce-Brown as part of 
his entry into the Young Persons' Lecture Competition hosted by the 
Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.

calcCorrMat - returns correlation matrix for desired theta (used by maxLfun)
example - script giving example calls of the functions and plots
krigeIt - returns kriging interpolation and confidence intervals
lfun - returns likelihood for multivariate Gaussian samples
maxLfun - finds the value of random field parameters (mu,sigma,theta) that
maximise 'lfun'
